The frequency response can be classified into a number of different bandforms describing which frequencies the filter passes (the passband) and which it rejects (the stopband):  
Low-pass filter – low frequencies are passed, high frequencies are attenuated.  
High-pass filter – high frequencies are passed, low frequencies are attenuated.  
Band-pass filter – only frequencies in a frequency band are passed.  
Band-stop filter or band-reject filter – only frequencies in a frequency band are attenuated.  
Notch filter – rejects just one specific frequency - an extreme band-stop filter.  
Comb filter – has multiple regularly spaced narrow passbands giving the bandform the appearance of a comb.  
All-pass filter – all frequencies are passed, but the phase of the output is modified.  

Cutoff frequency is the frequency beyond which the filter will not pass signals. It is usually measured at a specific attenuation such as 3dB.  
Roll-off is the rate at which attenuation increases beyond the cut-off frequency.  
Transition band, the (usually narrow) band of frequencies between a passband and stopband.  
Ripple is the variation of the filters insertion loss in the passband.  
The order of a filter is the degree of the approximating polynomial and in passive filters corresponds to the number of elements required to build it. Increasing order increases roll-off and brings the filter closer to the ideal response.
